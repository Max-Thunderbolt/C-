Coding Challenge: Design and implement a class hierarchy for managing a library. The library should have the following features:

Books, each with a title, author, ISBN, and number of copies available.
Members, each with a name, address, and membership number.
A borrowing system that allows members to borrow books and return them.
Additional Considerations:

Implement appropriate constructors, destructors, and member functions for each class.
Use inheritance to create relationships between classes.
Encapsulate data members and use accessors and mutators to control access.
Implement error handling to ensure that invalid data is not entered.
Document your code using comments.
This challenge will help you to practice your object-oriented programming skills, as well as your understanding of data structures and algorithms. It will also help you to develop your problem-solving and debugging skills.
